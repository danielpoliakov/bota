# BOTA - Botnet Analysis


BOTA (Botnet Analysis) is a PoC system demonstrating possibilities of detecting devices infected by IoT malware. The detection pipeline leverages the concept of so-called weak indicators and heterogeneous meta-classifiers to maintain accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art systems while also providing explainable results that are easy to understand.
